Project Name: Tarantula - The Web Crawler
File Name: main.py
Author: Pratik Ashok Paranjape
Date: 05/23/2020
Project Description:
This a project to demonstrate the use of standard python libraries like os, urllib, HTMLParser
to create a minimalist webpage crawler that crawls webpages on a website to gather hyperlinks (URLs)
File Description:
This is the main file that creates multiple threads and assigns jobs to these threads.
This file also is the starting point of the project's execution
